# Death, Dying, and the Beyond

The System and the world of Eldara are not free of peril and danger, and (fictional) death is always a possibility. There are several states of death, dying, and the beyond.

## Bleeding Out

Simply dying is not the end in The System. If a character is ever reduced to zero Body Points, they are now "bleeding out". They are also unconscious, and may not call out for help, activate abilities, call damage, or really do anything at all. The character bleeds out for 1 minute. Any healing effects or stabilizing effects done at this point will take effect, and they may be revived.

## Dead

After a character has bled out for 1 minute, they are "dead" for 4 minutes. While dead, normal healing has no effect. Only the use of a life or resuscitate effect may revive the character.

## Ashing

After the 4 minute death count has expired, that character's body then turns to ash. The character becomes ethereal, and a life effect will not succeed. A resurrect effect or resurrection circle must be utilized in order to be revived. If a player is ever resurrected, then they will gain aura.

## Aura

Aura measures the soul's power in The System. Each character begins with 0% aura. Every time that character resurrects, their aura score increases. The rate of the increase is determined by the number of events they have attended. Once a character's aura reaches 100% or more, that character may not be resurrected, and is effectively permanently dead, or "permed".

Aura can be reduced through special events and rituals. These opportunities are rare and often require significant character development or story involvement.

## Unconscious

Unconscious is a state that a character reaches through the effects of skills and spells. Note that this is not the same state as Bleeding Out - Unconscious by itself is not lethal. Unconscious has 2 outcomes, based on the way the character entered unconsciousness:

1. If the character was brought to Unconscious from Bleeding Out or Dying, they remain unconscious for one minute. At that time, they regain consciousness with 1 body.
2. If a character was brought to Unconscious from a conscious state, they remain Unconscious for 1 minute, then regain consciousness with no change to HP, unless it has been lowered while Unconscious.

Some effects may state a duration longer than the standard 1 minute. In that case, use the duration listed in the effect.

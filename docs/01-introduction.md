# Introduction

## What is The System?

First and foremost, The System is a Live Action Role Play, or LARP. There are millions of LARP themes out there -- everything from space age to medieval fantasy. From comic books to spies and espionage, from Wall Street to the Wild West, there is probably a LARP for it.

The System is set in a fantasy world called Eldara that is full of magic, mystery, beasts, and heroes. The System strives to mix several aspects of good and evil, sometimes even blurring the line between the two. The System is designed to make certain every player can live their legend, whether that means being a dark necromancer or a shining paladin.

## What if I have never role-played before?

The most difficult part of roleplaying is deciding to do it. Once you have made the decision, the first step is to read this book and get a grasp of the rules involved. From there, you can create your own character and begin to decide your own motivations in the world of Eldara. The system is designed to be as self-explanatory as it can be, and tries to reward veterans for helping out new players.

## Can anyone play?

Absolutely! We pride ourselves on providing a safe, fun environment that welcomes all roleplayers! We would like to note for new players that we suggest parents attend first without their child to assess if our world is appropriate for that child, as some plot may contain themes too mature for children. Additionally, while we do our best to accommodate everyone's needs, some of the site we utilize may prove difficult to access for those with physical limitations. For further questions about the appropriateness or accessibility of our system, please contact us via our website or Facebook page.

## Can I really do this?

Certainly! Every single LARPer, from the long time veteran playing the same character they've managed to keep alive for years to the most versatile NPC, started where you are now.

## How does my first event begin?

After you show up to a campsite for a weekend of fun and roleplay, the first step will be to check in with a greeter. More likely than not, this will mean a staff member flitting about all over the place making preparations for the weekend. These people can, when the time comes, help you with character construction if need be, help you out with your costume, weapons, supplies, and generally make sure you are ready for the game, as well as answering any and all questions you might have about The System or the weekend.

Once Logistics Division opens its doors, grab a spot in line to be processed into game. You will receive your character sheet and any in-game currency or item tags your character may have, as well as be checked over for safety of your armor, weapons, shields, and spell packets.

After, or perhaps before, you have made your way through Logistics, you will meet your Safety Marshal and be taken through New Player Orientation! Here, you will learn how to properly and safely execute combat, as well as learn about combat etiquette and general safety rules.

Once everyone has been through the process you just went through and it's just about time for game to start, you will be whisked away to Opening Ceremonies. Here, you will get to meet all of the staff members and NPCs of the event. You will be given a short primer for the plot of the weekend and receive some in-game information. From there, players and non-players alike will take their places and Game On will be called. Your weekend begins here!

## Who is who?

There are three kinds of people at a The System event:

1. **Staff**: The people who run The System LARP. These are the people who will help you with rules, plot, and all questions you might have about The System or the weekend.
2. **Player Characters (PCs)**: The characters you create to play in The System LARP. These characters are the "main" characters of the game, and they are the persona you will take during the event. PCs may gain CCP to grow stronger through playing events.
3. **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**: Characters created by plot. Whether they are merchants, lords, or goblins, they exist to further the story and atmosphere of the game. Their personalities, skills and interactions with PCs are decided by plot. NPCs do not always have character sheets, but do not grow as PCs do.

## Is it very complicated?

Just like learning anything new, LARPing has its own learning curve. We heavily suggest all players read this book, especially the sections that pertain to your character. Don't forget, knowledge is power! However, anything that you aren't certain of can be cleared up by a staff member. This often happens during combat, and happens very fast! Be sure to pay attention!

## Do I need a costume?

As the old saying goes, "the clothes make the man". This certainly is true in the case of LARPing. It is infinitely easier to leave your old self behind and fall into a new persona if you are dressed for the part, especially if everyone around you is also dressed fantastically! You don't have to spend a fortune on your costuming, though -- remember, you will be flitting about the woods and doing great battles in this garb. Above all, it should be weather-appropriate and comfortable, as well as fitting for a fantasy setting.

## Is there combat?

The world of Eldara is teeming with threats and dangers, not to mention the unsavory characters you might encounter, so combat is certainly going to be simulated. LARP combat is about taking hit points. It's more like a very fast-paced game of tag than bashing people in. All weapons and armors are checked for safety before each and every event. However, there are some intrinsic risks in any contact sport, so we do our best to make sure every situation is safe and secure, while still giving you that heart-racing adrenaline rush you might crave!

## Is there magic?

In the world of Eldara, magic lurks around every corner. Players, plants, animals, non-players, and all sorts of beings in the universe have access to magic. The System utilizes a spell packet-based magic system for casting spells. All most mages need to do is say the appropriate phrase and throw a spell packet in order for their magic to take effect. There are numerous spells, elixirs, scrolls, and runes, all of which are explained in this book!

## How does it all work?

Ultimately, the point of this rulebook is to explain to you how it all works. The rest of this book is designed to make sure you understand everything fairly well and are armed with the knowledge to go out and take the world of Eldara by storm!

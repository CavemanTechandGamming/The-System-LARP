# Honor System

In The System, we utilize and deeply value the Honor System. Naturally, this has its flaws, but we still feel that it's the best way to create a smoothly flowing and working environment.

The honor system itself works far better when the players implement it, not the system behind it. If a player wants to bend the rules for personal gain, or for the purpose of good and engaging roleplay, they will be able to do so. This also means that rules are sometimes bent to the detriment to the player involved, and that may be okay, too. Staff will sometimes bend rules to allow certain things to happen. If it goes well, the players will never know it happened.

The honor system also means that plot and staff will not hold your hand. You are held accountable for keeping up with your own hit points, and noticing which spells, effects, hits, and damages you take. Though some leeway will be allowed, if staff feels you are using and abusing the honor system, disciplinary action will be taken.

We do our best to enforce the honor system and we do take its application seriously. Enforcement is obviously a judgment call by the marshals, but great deliberation and care is given to each and every incident before a decision is made.

## Important Honor Code Rules

1. Play with out-of-game respect for people, places, and things. Yes, even the bad guys.
2. Do your absolute best to follow each and every rule as it is stated, even if you do not like it, or it is not beneficial to you.
3. If you make a mistake, admit it and ask a marshal to make a ruling.
4. Do everything in your power to avoid out-of-game problems.

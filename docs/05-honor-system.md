## Understanding the Honor System

In The System, we utilize and deeply value the Honor System. Naturally, this has its flaws, but we still feel that it's the best way to create a smoothly flowing and working environment.

## How It Works

The honor system itself works far better when the players implement it, not the system behind it. This means:

- Players may bend rules for personal gain or engaging roleplay
- Rules may be bent to a player's detriment (which can be acceptable)
- Staff may bend rules to facilitate certain events
- When done well, players may never know rule adjustments occurred

## Player Responsibilities

The honor system means that plot and staff will not hold your hand. You are responsible for:

- Tracking your own hit points
- Noting spells and effects affecting you
- Recording hits and damage taken
- Maintaining awareness of your character's status

While some leeway is allowed, abuse of the honor system will result in disciplinary action.

## Staff Enforcement

We take the honor system seriously and enforce it carefully:

- Enforcement decisions are made by marshals
- Each incident receives careful consideration
- Decisions are made after thorough deliberation
- Staff maintains consistency in rule application

## Important Rules

1. **Respect**: Play with out-of-game respect for people, places, and things. Yes, even the bad guys.

2. **Rule Adherence**: Do your absolute best to follow each and every rule as it is stated, even if you do not like it, or it is not beneficial to you.

3. **Honesty**: If you make a mistake, admit it and ask a marshal to make a ruling.

4. **Conflict Avoidance**: Do everything in your power to avoid out-of-game problems.

Remember: The honor system relies on mutual trust and respect between players and staff. By following these guidelines, we can maintain a fair and enjoyable gaming environment for everyone.

# Roleplaying

In The System, roleplaying is stressed above all else. It's the purest reason we play, and the force that turns The System from a concept into a living, breathing, powerful game state. Even those who play only for reasons like combat or the thrill will be roleplaying, too, and are just as much a part of the game as anyone else. The system's ultimate goal is to support nearly any type of roleplay, but roleplay itself is essential! Here is some advice to help you enjoy your experience, and make it seamless and fun for others, as well.

## Roleplaying Tips

### Try to roleplay an original character, not yourself in funny clothes
This is probably the hardest thing for new players. Try to spend some time thinking about your character's childhood, motivations, morals, hopes, and dreams. This will make them more like real people to be interacted with instead of cardboard cutouts to be looked at.

### Separate the mundane and the mystical
Keep things that are in game there, and things that are out of game in their own realms. Your out-of-game friends may become your mortal enemies in game, but that doesn't mean they dislike you in the real world. Someone you have a grudge with may be attending an event you are, too, but keep your feelings out of game as best you can.

### Follow the rules as they are put forth by the system
That doesn't mean just the rulebook. Sometimes staff has to make calls on the field that may or may not align exactly with the rulebook's wording. We strive to have each ruling worded perfectly to avoid any confusion, but we don't live in a perfect world.

### Practice makes perfect!
Try making faces in the mirror! Practicing talking, standing, walking, running, and fighting like your character will make it easier to fall into that character time and time again.

### Know how to resolve a problem
If a problem cannot be resolved by those involved, then staff may need to become involved. Everyone should know how to call for a clarify, retrieve staff, and resolve the issue.

### There are always bigger fish in the sea
You have your own strengths and abilities. You may not always be the fastest, strongest, smartest, or most ready. Don't compare yourself to others, especially veteran players. LARP is a great place to challenge yourself. Do what makes you excited or scared. Just try to be safe!

### You only get out what you put in
The ratio of effort to fun in LARP is 1:1. If you fall into your character headfirst and go out to find fun and adventure, then you are almost guaranteed to step in something fun!

### Stay in character!
We all know there are people here you want to talk to out of game. We all have friends who enjoy this hobby as much as we do. However, please try to stay in game as much as you can. It makes the game environment much better.

### Know the Rules
Knowing is half the battle. This rulebook is the first step to enjoying The System.

### Learn about Magic
Even non-mages have spells cast on them. Knowing about the most common magic effects and the way spells in general work will help clarify many issues and ensure a smoothly flowing game state.

### Talk to people!
Remember, LARP is a social activity! Talking to people in game and out of game can help you have a more pleasurable experience. Not all roleplay is scripted by the staff. Make your own by buying a drink for a fellow roleplayer, entering a gambling game in the tavern, or anything else you can think of!

### Go exploring!
Eldara is a big wide world, and not all of the adventure to be had is inside the tavern! Go prowling in the night, looking for jewels and animals to slay. Remember -- when exploring, always take a friend!

### Make friends, allies, and enemies!
If everyone likes you, you are probably LARPing well, but maybe not correctly. Making enemies in game is perfectly normal and natural, and part of the fun! Making allies and friends to help you with your causes, as well as friends out of game is one of the most gratifying parts of LARPing.

### Stay Active!
After a harrowing battle against the forces of destruction, it is tempting, and totally ok, to go have a pint of ale in the tavern. However, don't spend your entire weekend in the tavern and cabins if you can help it! Go out and find some adventure to tell your friends about so they'll come with you next time!

## Costuming

Renaissance faires, online stores, custom costume creators, and even thrift shops are great places to fulfill your costuming needs. Veteran players can help you find a variety of retail options. You can find armor of all types, shirts, pants, tights, doublets, bodices, skirts, kilts, and all the accessories to go with.

If you want to create a fantasy look, you can do this by looking at yard sales, consignment shops, or your local Goodwill. These can be the perfect places to find the "raw materials" to create your own look while saving you money. Old leather coats or vests can easily be made into armor. Old oversized belts are perfect for costumes. Check out the jewelry, too; sometimes, the more tasteless and garish, the better.

It is best to have an idea of what you want your character to look like before you start buying things. A quick look in your own closet may be a good place to start.

The part that most people put the least amount of thought into when creating a costume is footwear. You could be the meanest barbarian ever, but it would be silly to see your character in a loincloth and Nikes. Many players will cover their existing shoes with fake fur or leather, which can be used to make boot spats. Try to stick with black sneakers or hiking shoes, at the very least.

Craft shops can be a great place to find bits and pieces of fake fur, leather, or a sturdy bit of wool or cotton. Even if you can't sew, there are fabric glues, iron-on strips, and plain old safety pins. With just a few dollars, some imagination, and a dash of ingenuity, creating a costume is one of the best parts of the game.

### Racial Costuming Requirements

Certain races must wear specific items:
- Elves have pointy ears and wear them the entire event. They can cover their ears, but cannot remove them while in game.
- A dwarf cannot remove their beard when it gets hot out.

Before choosing a race that has to wear these elements, be sure that you wish to do so. Poor use of racial prosthetics will disqualify the player from choosing non-human races. No wigs, beards, or other prosthesis are allowed unless your character starts with them.

## Cursing

Everyone will want to curse out another LARPer at one point or another. Remember, while cursing isn't banned in The System, there may or may not be children in your immediate vicinity when your in game conversations get heated. Please try your very best to make certain of your surroundings and tailor your language appropriately.

## Religion

The System has an in-game religion system that we encourage all characters to utilize. However, The System will not tolerate religious iconography or worship practices that emulate or mock out of game religions. Religious jokes or offense taken by roleplay will be taken very seriously by The System staff, and disciplinary action may or may not be taken, pending a warning. Please be respectful of other's religious sensibilities, and remember that religion is very important to some, and may be a touchy subject.

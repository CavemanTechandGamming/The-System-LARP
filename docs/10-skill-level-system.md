# Skill Level System

The System utilizes a skill level system rather than a player level system. For example, instead of a 17th level fighter, your fighter may have 17th level skills. You obtain these skills by purchasing them with Character Creation Points (CCP), and their cost varies dependent upon your class, race, and the skill you want to buy, as well as the level of the skill.

All skills have twenty levels each and are purchased with CCP in a pyramid fashion to determine the level attained in that particular skill.

For example, if a player were purchasing a skill with a Base Cost of 5 CCP, they would spend:
- 5 CCP to attain the first level
- 10 points for the second level
- 15 points for the third
- 20 for the fourth
- And so on

If the base cost were 6 points originally, then it would be:
- 6 for first
- 12 for second
- 18 for third
- etc.

Some skills, abilities, and race traits allow you to reduce the Base Cost of certain skills. No ability may reduce any Base Cost below 3 for any skill.

## Skill Level Cost Table

We know that some people like to try it by hand before arriving to site. For those who wish to create characters this way, here is a table to make the math a bit simpler for you. To calculate the total cost to buy up to a particular level of a skill, find the row for the desired level and multiply the base cost of the skill by the number in the "multiplier" column.

| Total Level Desired | Multiplier |
|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |
| 6 | 21 |
| 7 | 28 |
| 8 | 36 |
| 9 | 45 |
| 10 | 55 |
| 11 | 66 |
| 12 | 78 |
| 13 | 91 |
| 14 | 105 |
| 15 | 120 |
| 16 | 136 |
| 17 | 153 |
| 18 | 171 |
| 19 | 190 |
| 20 | 210 |

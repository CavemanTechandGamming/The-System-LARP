# Miscellaneous Rules

In The System, there are a lot of rulings and rules that don't necessarily appear in everyday context, and sometimes blur the line between what is in and out of game. While some of these rules don't pop up very often, it is incredibly important to know them, because they may help you avoid a sticky situation. In general, it is best to use common sense in all things, but we will list a few things here for you to remember.

## Re-ups

Some bonuses from skills have limited uses, such as the number of strikes granted by the Finesse skill or the amount of mana granted by a school of magic. Any bonus granted by a skill is considered "refreshed" at each re-up and may be used again before the next re-up. This does not include body points, item durabilities, or the current bonus of any unrepaired armor pieces.

## Smoking

Smoking was part of society in the eras of renaissance, and thusly it is an in-game activity in The System. If you go out to have a cigarette, there is no guarantee that you won't be met with an angry goblin or two, no different than the person out for a leisurely stroll. Also, be respectful of the out of game sites we are utilizing. Do not smoke indoors under any circumstances, and dispose of all your cigarette butts or pipe tamping appropriately.

## Alcohol

Alcohol is not permitted at The System events. Those consuming alcohol, arriving under the effects of alcohol, leaving and returning under the effects of alcohol, or even in possession of alcohol will be ejected immediately from the event. Due to player age factors, as well as insurance policies, this will not change.

## Drugs

Drugs are not permitted on The System premises. Those with drugs on their person, in their belongings, or who use or arrive under the influence of any drugs will not only be ejected, they will receive a lifetime permanent ban. As appropriate, law enforcement will be contacted.

## Marshal/Cabin Notes

Sometimes staff or players will cast protective spells, add traps, create portals, or cause other effects on doorways or inside buildings or tents. These things must be reported to the marshals. This way, when entering a structure, a staff member will be able to call any effects that may be triggered, or if entry is even possible.

## Object Tags

In The System, just about every item has a tag. An item tag is essentially a character sheet for an item. Tags are printed on business cards, so that you can utilize and trade them easily. Tags will tell everything there is to know about an item, and can even act as that item if it is stolen or misplaced. A phys rep without a tag is no item at all, so hold on to them!

## Bathrooms

Restrooms in The System are strictly out of game areas due to safety and privacy concerns. Game will never take place in a restroom, but players should also refrain from waiting in the restroom for dangers to pass. Monsters and players alike found waiting outside the restroom to strike at players will be dealt with by staff, and disciplinary action may be taken.

## Disciplinary Action

There are many circumstances in The System that may be dealt with via staff disciplinary action, many of which have been listed in this rulebook. Disciplinary action can mean a number of things, from a character losing hit points or aura points for foul play, to being assigned to an immediate npc shift, down to a player being banned or expelled from events for serious infractions. Most disciplinary actions will come with a warning, but typically only one warning. Keep this in mind and remember the things you learned in this rulebook.

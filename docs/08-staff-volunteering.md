# Staff and Volunteering

Now you have attended several LARP events, and you are excited and interested to be part of making the story happen! Currently, official staff positions are by invitation only. However, The System takes a certain number of volunteers each month to help plot with telling the weekend's story by being NPCs. Being an NPC comes with several benefits, including:

1. Chances to play races, classes, and skills you haven't had the opportunity to.
2. Earning CCP at the same rate as PC-ing, without the risk of death or having to pay the event fee.
3. Earning eternal gratitude from your plot and staff members.

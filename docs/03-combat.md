# Combat

## General Combat

The primary rule of combat in The System is that everything must be as safe as possible for everyone, even those who may not be involved. If you are at all unsure about the safety of an action, don't do it. We realize that combat in-game is unlike real combat, which is exactly what we want. The purpose of real combat is injury. In the olden days, the goal was injuring an opponent enough to prevent retaliation, even if it meant death - and it often did.

The System wants to create the best roleplay environment ever created in a system of this nature. This can only happen when we have players, and we won't for very long if they're all being carted off the field in ambulances. That is why we stress that our players roleplay combat. We don't want, nor will we allow, real combat at any time.

## The Hold/Clarify Rule

This is one of the most important rules in combat. Any player is capable of calling a hold or clarify. This is done simply by saying or shouting the word "HOLD" or "CLARIFY".

When a Clarify or Hold is called, everything within that hold or clarify is out of game until it re-enters game via a three count. The three count will typically begin with the call of "Is there any reason for this hold to continue?" or, in the case of a clarify "Ready, ready, ready." Followed by "Three, Two, One, Play On." Only the person who called the hold or clarify or a staff member is capable of resuming game.

### Hold Situations
- Medical emergency
- Imminent physical danger
- Unsafe situation
- Out of game interference (car driving through the area of play, joggers running by)
- A break in game (scheduled lunch, scheduled breaks)

### Clarify Situations
- Rules question
- Marshal Call
- In game effect takes place
- Identification of a costumed character
- Used by plot to describe situations

Due to their nature, holds are to be used only for emergency or potentially dangerous situations. Clarify should cover just about all else. We also heavily suggest that during a hold, everyone able to go down on one knee do so. This allows other players to see you are in a hold and stop what they are doing if they did not hear the call. It also ceases movement so that anything dangerous or anyone injured or ill can be moved safely.

Remember, during a hold or a clarify, you are out of game! This means you cannot sneak up on someone to kill them, nor can you look about for who is sneaking up on you. A hold or clarify is not an excuse to pick up arrows or spell packets, examine your opponents for weaknesses, or even switch weapons.

## Home Run Blows

In the The System, only light contact during combat is allowed. The combat system is designed to be like a game of tag with weapons and spells. Blows are not to be swung with any power behind them. The rule of thumb is 50% acceleration and 50% deceleration. This means pick up speed through the first half of your strike to make it look realistic, but bring that speed back down nearly to nothing by the time you tag your target.

Combat speed is far more important than the power behind your blows, in terms of damage. The lighter the blows, the faster you can recover and strike again. You also don't find yourself completing a lot of illegal blows, which would do no damage anyway. The more legal blows you complete, the more damage your target will take in a shorter period of time. Violation of this rule is not tolerated and is dealt with harshly.

## Illegal Targets

The System does not allow any blows to the head, neck, or groin. Although this can be a difficult thing to assure, especially with your target bouncing around like a Nilbog in a Necromantic tower, you really need to give great care as to where you are aiming. For this reason, you are also not allowed to strike at targets that you cannot see. Another good rule of thumb is when in doubt, don't swing a blow that might result in hitting an illegal area.

## Tripping

Blows designed to make someone fall are not allowed. These include things like swinging at a target's legs while they are running, low sweeping staff moves, tangling your weapon with the target's legs, etc. Tripping is not tolerated and will result in staff intervention.

## Charging

Charging is movement with the chief result of immediate contact. If your movement causes your target to believe that immediate contact is unavoidable, you're guilty of charging.

## Turtling

Shields are another facet of the The System combat system that is not exactly realistically portrayed. Turtling is defined as completely covering oneself behind a shield so only the head is available as a target. This is called turtling and it is illegal.

## Body Contact Rule

No one may touch another person except by The System safety-inspected weapons or packets without direct permission. Everyone must request permission for contact each time. Even if you have known each other for years, permission needs to be given under each occurrence of combat. Violation of this rule is also a quick way to receive disciplinary action.

### Opt-In Contact System
Players who are comfortable with light physical contact during roleplay (such as hugs, handshakes, or an arm over the shoulder) may wear a clearly visible green armband or badge. This indicates they have opted into light physical contact without explicit permission for each interaction. However, this does not override common sense or safety:
- Combat-related contact still requires explicit permission
- No contact to illegal areas (head, neck, groin)
- No forceful contact (pushing, shoving, etc.)
- Players can still call "HOLD" at any time if they feel uncomfortable
- The opt-in status can be revoked at any time by removing the indicator

Players who do not wear this indicator must be asked for permission before any physical contact. Respecting these boundaries is crucial for maintaining a safe and comfortable environment for all players.

Players who wish to explicitly opt out of all physical contact (except for safety-inspected weapons and packets) may wear a clearly visible red armband or badge. This is an absolute indicator that no physical contact is permitted, regardless of the situation. This includes:
- No hugs, handshakes, or other friendly contact
- No roleplay-initiated contact
- No exceptions for combat or other game mechanics (except for safety-inspected weapons and packets)
- No exceptions for friends or long-time players

The red indicator takes precedence over any other contact permissions and must be respected without question. Players wearing the red indicator should not be asked for permission to make contact, as the answer is always no.

## Drum Rolling/Machine Gunning

The terms "drum rolling" and "machine gunning" refer to firing off very fast blows to the same body location of a target. This is usually accompanied by a long string of "2normal2normal2normal2normal". A good hint that you are drum rolling is that you are not able to call damage quickly enough in an understandable manner.

The first blow for machine gunning counts, but all further shots in the stream do not. To guarantee that you won't be found guilty of machine gunning, simply hit a different body location on each strike or withdraw the weapon at least 45 degrees between hits.

## Trapping/Pinning

Trapping is defined as using your weapon or body to make another weapon unable to be drawn back by an opponent. Trapping is illegal and will result in disciplinary action. Do not confuse trapping with pinning. Pinning is the act of using your weapon to trap someone else's weapon against an object, such as a tree or building.

## Packet Delivered Attacks

Packet delivered attacks have no illegal targets. Although we ask that a player doesn't specifically aim for an illegal area, such an attack still counts. Flagrant targeting of illegal areas may still receive disciplinary action, so don't think this gives you free reign to go around beaming people in the forehead with birdseed. If a marshal gets the impression that a player is trying to do out-of-game damage to another player, disciplinary action is likely to occur.

## Armor Rating System

While out and about you may discover or purchase a variety of armor pieces. Armor, like all other game items, requires an item tag to be utilized by a player. To wear armor, it must be physically represented by actual costuming and armor. The System uses four "areas" of worn armor:

1. Head
2. Chest
3. Arm
4. Leg

Armor must roughly cover the specified area, but stylized armor is allowed. The amount of armor a character gains from a given piece of armor will be listed on that item's tag. Additionally, if the character has taken the skill Extra Armor, all armor they wear will be worth more than what is listed on a given item tag.

## Area of Effect Attacks

There are also some effects that encompass an area. All targets caught in the area suffer the same effect as everyone else in the area if they are so affectable. In the description of each area of effect, the exact area covered is provided. These effects are followed immediately by a clarify call, which will designate which area and characters have been affected.

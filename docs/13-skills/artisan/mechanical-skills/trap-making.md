# Trap Making Skill

The Trap Making skill allows characters to create various mechanical and magical traps for defense, hunting, or other purposes. Trap makers are essential for creating security systems and specialized hunting equipment. This skill combines mechanical knowledge with practical application to create devices of both protection and precision.

## Skill Description
Trap Making is the art of designing and constructing devices that can capture, harm, or alert to the presence of targets. Trap makers must understand mechanics, materials, and the behavior of their intended targets. This skill requires both theoretical knowledge of mechanical principles and practical experience in applying them.

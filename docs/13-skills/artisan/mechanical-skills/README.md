# Mechanical Skills

Mechanical skills focus on creating mechanical devices, traps, and complex machinery. These skills combine engineering principles with practical application to create functional and sometimes dangerous devices.

## Available Skills

### [Engineering](engineering.md)
The art of designing and building complex mechanical devices. Engineers can:
- Create mechanical devices and machinery
- Design automated systems
- Build complex mechanisms
- Create mechanical defenses

### [Trap Making](trap-making.md)
The craft of creating mechanical traps and defensive devices. Trap makers can:
- Create various types of traps
- Design defensive mechanisms
- Build alarm systems
- Create complex trigger mechanisms

## Skill Interactions
Mechanical skills often work with other artisan skills:
- Engineers can create components for other craftspeople
- Trap makers can integrate with magical and mechanical systems
- Both skills can work together to create complex devices

## Requirements
Each mechanical skill has its own specific requirements, but all require:
- Engineering tools and equipment
- Suitable workspace
- Various materials and components
- Knowledge of mechanical principles

## Progression
The mechanical skill system includes:
- Basic devices at lower levels
- More complex mechanisms at higher levels
- Special abilities at levels 10 and 20
- Increasing production points with level
- Ability to create unique devices at higher levels

## Safety Considerations
Mechanical work requires special care:
- Proper testing of all devices
- Safe handling of dangerous components
- Understanding of mechanical interactions
- Proper maintenance procedures
- Protection against mechanical failures
- Clear documentation of device operation
- Proper disposal of dangerous materials

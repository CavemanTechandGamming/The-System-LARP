# Gathering Skills

## Overview
Gathering skills form the essential foundation of resource acquisition in the artisan system, representing the critical first step in the creation of any item. These skills focus on the careful and efficient collection of raw materials from the natural world, ensuring that artisans have access to the resources they need to create their works. Each gathering skill specializes in a particular type of resource, requiring specific knowledge and techniques to maximize yield and quality.

Gathering skills are unique in that they:
- Provide the raw materials for all crafting
- Require knowledge of resource locations and properties
- Involve both physical skill and environmental awareness
- Often require specialized tools and equipment
- Can be affected by environmental conditions
- May have seasonal or time-based considerations
- Require proper preservation techniques
- Can impact the local environment

The mastery of gathering skills is essential for:
- Supporting all crafting professions
- Maintaining resource sustainability
- Understanding material properties
- Preserving resource quality
- Maximizing collection efficiency
- Contributing to the economy
- Protecting natural resources
- Advancing material knowledge

## Skills

### [Forestry](forestry.md)
The specialized skill of managing and harvesting wood resources. Foresters can identify valuable trees, understand wood properties, and sustainably harvest materials while maintaining forest health. This skill is crucial for obtaining quality wood for woodworking and other crafts.

### [Herbalism](herbalism.md)
The practice of gathering plants and herbs from the environment. Herbalists can identify useful plants, understand their properties, and properly harvest and preserve them for various uses. This skill is vital for obtaining materials used in alchemy and other magical crafts.

### [Mining](mining.md)
The art of extracting metal ores and gems from underground deposits and rock formations. Miners can locate valuable deposits, safely extract materials, and process raw ores into usable forms. This skill is essential for obtaining materials used in blacksmithing and jewelcrafting.

### [Skinning](skinning.md)
The skill of harvesting animal hides and leather from creatures. Skinners can properly remove and preserve hides, ensuring maximum quality and usability for leatherworking. This skill is crucial for obtaining materials used in leatherworking and tailoring.

## Skill System

### Quality Levels
Each gathering skill has five quality levels that determine the effectiveness and value of gathered materials:
- Basic (Levels 1-5): Common materials with basic quality
- Standard (Levels 6-10): Reliable materials with improved quality
- Good (Levels 11-14): High-quality materials with enhanced properties
- Excellent (Levels 15-19): Exceptional materials with superior properties
- Masterwork (Level 20): Legendary materials with exceptional properties

### Production Points
Production points (pp) are used to track the amount of gathering that can be done in a given time period. The points scale from 25 pp at level 1 to 500 pp at level 20, with an even progression of 25 pp per level. This allows gatherers to:
- Gather larger quantities
- Process more complex materials
- Work more efficiently
- Handle multiple tasks
- Meet higher demands

### Common Requirements
Each gathering skill has its own specific requirements, but all require:
- Appropriate tools for gathering
- Suitable containers for materials
- Knowledge of gathering locations
- Time to complete the work
- Basic knowledge of the skill
- Understanding of materials
- Proper safety measures
- Quality control processes

### Common Elements
Each gathering skill includes:
- Detailed description of the skill
- Role-playing aspects and personality traits
- Prestige levels and recognition
- Level bonuses and production points
- Material types and quality levels
- Requirements for tools and containers
- Step-by-step gathering process
- Physical actions and environmental effects
- Technical and safety considerations
- Business and role-playing considerations

# Artisan Concentration Skill

This skill allows a character to pause any artisan skill or ability requiring a count that is in progress when the character is interrupted in any way. The character may resume the skill's count at any time with a three-count resume. If the pause reaches its duration and the character has not resumed crafting, another use of this skill must be consumed to increase the length of the pause. Otherwise, the item being created is destroyed, and half the production points that were being used towards that item are consumed.

## Prestiges
- **Level 10: Keen Awareness** - Allows a character, when using Artisan Concentration, to gain a 10 second Evade effect. This does not occur when extending a pause count.
- **Level 20: Excellent Blueprints** - Allows a character to reduce the remaining time of a paused Artisan count by 10 seconds for each level of the related Production skill they possess when resuming the paused count.

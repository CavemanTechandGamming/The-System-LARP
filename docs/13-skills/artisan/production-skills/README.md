# Production Skills

## Overview
Production skills represent the optimization and enhancement aspects of the artisan system, focusing on improving efficiency, quality, and maintenance in the crafting process. These skills act as force multipliers for other artisan skills, allowing craftspeople to work more effectively, produce higher quality items, and maintain their creations. Each production skill specializes in a different aspect of the production process, from quality control to mass production, requiring both technical knowledge and practical experience.

Production skills are unique in that they:
- Enhance the capabilities of other artisan skills
- Focus on process optimization and efficiency
- Require understanding of multiple crafting disciplines
- Can improve both quality and quantity
- Often involve systematic approaches
- May require specialized tools and equipment
- Can affect multiple aspects of production
- Create value through process improvement

The mastery of production skills is essential for:
- Improving overall crafting efficiency
- Maintaining and repairing items
- Ensuring consistent quality
- Scaling production capabilities
- Optimizing resource usage
- Reducing production costs
- Supporting other artisans
- Advancing production methods

## Skills

### [Artisan Concentration](artisan_concentration.md)
The ability to maintain focus and precision during extended crafting sessions. This skill allows artisans to work longer and more efficiently while maintaining quality standards, reducing the chance of mistakes, and improving overall productivity.

### [Crafting Efficiency](crafting-efficiency.md)
The art of optimizing workflow and production processes. Efficiency specialists can analyze crafting methods, identify bottlenecks, and implement improvements to maximize productivity while maintaining quality standards.

### [Item Repair](item-repair.md)
The art of restoring damaged items to their original condition. Repair specialists can fix everything from simple wear and tear to complex magical damage, using various techniques and materials.

### [Mass Production](mass-production.md)
The practice of creating items in bulk while maintaining quality standards. Mass producers can efficiently create large quantities of items while ensuring each item meets quality requirements.

### [Quality Control](quality-control.md)
The specialized skill of inspecting and testing crafted items. Quality control specialists ensure that all products meet established standards, identify potential issues, and maintain consistent quality across production.

### [Quality Crafting](quality-crafting.md)
The skill of improving item quality through advanced techniques and attention to detail. Quality crafters can enhance existing items or ensure new items meet the highest standards of craftsmanship.

### [Resource Management](resource-management.md)
The practice of optimizing material usage and inventory control. Resource managers can track material flow, minimize waste, and ensure efficient use of resources throughout the crafting process.

## Skill System

### Quality Levels
Each production skill has five quality levels that determine the effectiveness and value of the production process:
- Basic (Levels 1-5): Simple production processes with basic efficiency
- Standard (Levels 6-10): Reliable production processes with improved efficiency
- Good (Levels 11-14): High-quality production processes with enhanced efficiency
- Excellent (Levels 15-19): Exceptional production processes with superior efficiency
- Masterwork (Level 20): Legendary production processes with exceptional efficiency

### Production Points
Production points (pp) are used to track the amount of production work that can be done in a given time period. The points scale from 25 pp at level 1 to 500 pp at level 20, with an even progression of 25 pp per level. This allows production specialists to:
- Handle larger production runs
- Manage more complex processes
- Work more efficiently
- Handle multiple tasks
- Meet higher demands

### Common Requirements
Each production skill has its own specific requirements, but all require:
- Appropriate production tools
- Suitable production workspace
- Quality control systems
- Time to complete the work

- Proper safety measures
- Quality control processes

### Common Elements
Each production skill includes:
- Detailed description of the skill
- Role-playing aspects and personality traits
- Prestige levels and recognition
- Level bonuses and production points
- Production types and quality levels
- Requirements for tools and systems
- Step-by-step production process
- Physical actions and environmental effects
- Technical and safety considerations
- Business and role-playing considerations

# Mass Production Skill

The Mass Production skill allows characters to efficiently create large quantities of items while maintaining consistent quality. Mass producers are essential for meeting high demand and optimizing production processes.

## Skill Description
Mass Production is the art of creating multiple items efficiently while maintaining quality standards. Mass producers must understand production optimization, resource management, and quality control at scale.

## Prestiges
- **Level 10: Master Producer** - Allows the efficient production of complex items and the ability to maintain high quality at scale.
- **Level 20: Grand Master Producer** - Grants the ability to create unique production lines and optimize complex manufacturing processes (subject to administrative approval).

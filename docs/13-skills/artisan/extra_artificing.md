# Extra Artificing Skill

This skill gives a character extra production points to use for Artificing. Deconstruct allows a character to deconstruct any magic item with 10 minutes of roleplay and obtain a portion (10% per level of Deconstruct) of all production points that went into making the item if the item was made using the production system.

## Prestiges
- **Level 10: Order From Chaos** - Allows a character to reduce their Artifice roleplay times if they do not take breaks longer than 5 minutes between their projects. Scrolls and wands are completed 30 seconds faster for each previous project. Augments and Alterations are completed 5 minutes faster for each previous project. This ability can reduce a roleplay time to a minimum of 3 seconds.
- **Level 20: Law of Conservation** - Allows a character to Deconstruct any number of Artificer items per day and obtain 100% of the production points that went into that item.

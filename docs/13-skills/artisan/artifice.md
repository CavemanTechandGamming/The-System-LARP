# Artifice Skill

This skill allows a character to create special items. Some of these items, such as Wands and Scrolls, can be general aids to anyone. Artificers can also create very unique items that modify the abilities of existing items, or even characters. Augments, Enhancements and Focuses must be equipped to characters and items to have an effect. This is represented in-game by attaching the Artificer's item to another item tag or character sheet in some fashion, such as a paper-clip or tape.

## Prestiges
- **Level 10: Upgrade!** - Grants the Upgrade! effects listed in the Artificer ability descriptions in Section 14.
- **Level 20: Masterwork** - Allows a character to draft physical blueprints for a Marvel. A Marvel is an item with an appearance, effects, and cost determined by the player, with no limitations. A Marvel must be approved by the administrative team, who have the right to change the Marvel at any time afterwards. A character can only ever create one Marvel and can destroy their Marvel and blueprints to begin construction on a new Marvel.

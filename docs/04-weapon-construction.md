# Weapon Construction

Many people, whether due to budget constraints, creative powers, practical skill, or desire to be different may wish to craft their own weapons. This can be done in ways so numerous it would take up too much time to list them here. If you wish to learn how to safely construct any and all weapons, the internet is a wonderful resource.

The System welcomes DIY weapons. However, each weapon type has a specific size that must be adhered to so that it can be easily distinguished. You can find these sizes in the chart below.

## Weapon Requirements

Each weapon must have a 2-3 inch thrusting tip constructed using open cell foam. If the weapon is between 48 and 72 inches, the weapon must have a 3 inch thrusting tip. For safety reasons, weapons may not have any pieces which could accidentally catch or wrap around another player, such as scythes or flails.

Missile weapons may fire spell packets or staff-approved foam-tipped projectiles. The table below includes safety parameters for common missile weapon types. Inch pounds are used to measure crossbow power instead of pounds. This can be found by multiplying the draw weight of the crossbow by the length of the draw.

All weapons must be safety approved before use on site.

## Weapon Size Requirements

| Weapon Type | Minimum | Maximum |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Mini | 8 inches | 16 inches |
| Medium | 16 inches | 48 inches |
| Monstrous | 48 inches | 72 inches |
| Bow | 10 pounds | 25 pounds |
| Crossbow | 300 inch pounds | 500 inch pounds |
| Slingshot | 8 inches | 16 inches |

## Spell Packet Construction

Spell packets are essential items in The System, used for:
- Delivering magical effects
- Representing thrown objects (stones, potions, etc.)
- Physically representing small in-game items

### Safety First
- Only parakeet seed is allowed as filling material
- Do not use substitutes like sunflower seeds, BBs, or kitty litter
- Packets must not be overstuffed - they should be firm but not hard
- All packets must be safety inspected before use

### Required Materials
- Fabric: One 6" Ã— 6" square
- Filling: Parakeet seed only
- Container: One 35mm film canister (for construction)
- Fastener: Rubber bands

### Step-by-Step Construction
1. **Create the Pocket**
   - Place the fabric square over the film canister opening
   - Push the center down to form a pocket
   - Ensure no fabric edges are inside the canister

2. **Add the Filling**
   - Fill the pocket with parakeet seed
   - Do not overfill - the packet should be firm but not hard
   - A properly filled packet should have some give when squeezed

3. **Secure the Packet**
   - Gather the fabric edges and twist to close
   - Wrap rubber bands around the twisted area
   - Continue wrapping until the seed cannot escape
   - Test the packet by gently shaking it

### Quality Check
Before using your spell packet, verify that:
- The packet is not overstuffed
- No seed can escape
- The fabric is securely fastened
- The packet feels firm but not hard

Remember: Unsafe packets will not be allowed in-game. When in doubt, make a new packet rather than risk using an unsafe one.

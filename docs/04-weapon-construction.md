# Weapon Construction

Many people, whether due to budget constraints, creative powers, practical skill, or desire to be different may wish to craft their own weapons. This can be done in ways so numerous it would take up too much time to list them here. If you wish to learn how to safely construct any and all weapons, the internet is a wonderful resource.

The System welcomes DIY weapons. However, each weapon type has a specific size that must be adhered to so that it can be easily distinguished. You can find these sizes in the chart below.

## Weapon Requirements

Each weapon must have a 2-3 inch thrusting tip constructed using open cell foam. If the weapon is between 48 and 72 inches, the weapon must have a 3 inch thrusting tip. For safety reasons, weapons may not have any pieces which could accidentally catch or wrap around another player, such as scythes or flails.

Missile weapons may fire spell packets or staff-approved foam-tipped projectiles. The table below includes safety parameters for common missile weapon types. Inch pounds are used to measure crossbow power instead of pounds. This can be found by multiplying the draw weight of the crossbow by the length of the draw.

All weapons must be safety approved before use on site.

## Weapon Size Requirements

| Weapon Type | Minimum | Maximum |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Mini | 8 inches | 16 inches |
| Medium | 16 inches | 48 inches |
| Monstrous | 48 inches | 72 inches |
| Bow | 10 pounds | 25 pounds |
| Crossbow | 300 inch pounds | 500 inch pounds |
| Slingshot | 8 inches | 16 inches |

## Spell Packet Construction

Spell packets are used to deliver any and all magical effects, as well as act as stones for throwing, potion bottles for tossing, and physically representing just about any small object. They should be constructed from squares of fabric and parakeet seed. No substitutions may be made.

### Materials Needed:
1. 6 x 6 inch square of fabric
2. Parakeet seed
   - Note: Only parakeet seed is acceptable. No sunflower seeds, BBs, kitty litter, etc.
3. 35mm Film Canister
4. Rubber Bands

### Procedure:
1. Take the 6 x 6 inch square of fabric and put it over the open end of the film canister.
2. Push down on the center of the cloth so that it forms a pocket inside the canister. No edges should be inside of the canister.
3. Fill the pocket created inside the canister with parakeet seed.
4. Grab the edges of the cloth and twist to close.
5. Wrap a rubber band around the twisted area of the cloth until no parakeet seed is able to escape.
6. Make sure the parakeet seed is not too tight. Packets that are too packed with seed are unsafe and will not be allowed in-game.

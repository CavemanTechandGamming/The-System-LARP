# Production System

## Overview
The Production System allows characters to craft in-game items through three major methods:
- Artificing
- Forging Items
- Mixing Elixirs

Each system provides unique advantages to aid characters' allies and overcome enemies.

## Universal Production Rules

- Can speak with others during crafting
- Leaving crafting area or performing major actions ruins the item
